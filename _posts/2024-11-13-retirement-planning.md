# Retirement Planning for Millennials: A Step-by-Step Guide

Planning for retirement may seem far off when you're in your 20s or 30s, but the earlier you start, the more you'll benefit in the long run. Here’s how to build a solid retirement plan from the ground up.

## 1. Start Contributing to Retirement Accounts Early

Open a retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Many employers offer a 401(k) match, which is essentially free money. 

### Tip: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of it.

## 2. Understand Your Retirement Needs

Estimate how much you’ll need in retirement. A general rule is to aim for 70-80% of your pre-retirement income, but this varies depending on your lifestyle.

## 3. Open a Retirement Account

If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k), consider opening an IRA (Individual Retirement Account). With a Roth IRA, your contributions grow tax-free.

## 4. Contribute Consistently

Set up automatic contributions to your retirement account to ensure that you’re consistently saving.

## 5. Diversify Your Investments

Spread your investments across different types of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk and increase your chances of long-term growth.
